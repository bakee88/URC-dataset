# URC-dataset
Underwater real capture dataset (URC dataset)
We constructed datasets A and B by selecting underwater videos from video websites intercepting the images according to certain frames and manually selecting clear and blurred images. The underwater images are enhanced using CycleGAN's feature of transforming the images with only non-imaging pairs.
