# URC-dataset
Underwater real capture dataset (URC dataset)
We constructed datasets A and B by selecting underwater videos from video websites and intercepting the images according to certain frames and manually selecting what we consider to be clear and blurred images.The underwater images are enhanced using CycleGAN's feature of transforming the images with only non-imaging pairs.
